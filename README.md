**because sometimes even you can't tell the difference.**

this is a deep learning model that predicts if an image contains a cat or a dog. why? because why not.

## 🚀 how to run locally (nobody cares but formality)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paudelsamir/cat-vs-dog-classifier.git

    ```
    
2. **install dependencies**
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
3. **run it**
    
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
